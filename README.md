# _Why?_ Ecosystem

This project is comprised of 3 different components. One back-end server and two front-ends.

The back-end server is written in Python and Flask. It handles user authentication and aggregates
the data for all the users connected devices / front-ends.

The two front ends available are an Android launcher and a Chrome extension.

These separate projects are available as separate branches in this repository:

- **Android Launcher**: `git checkout android`
- **Chrome Extension**: `git checkout chrome`
